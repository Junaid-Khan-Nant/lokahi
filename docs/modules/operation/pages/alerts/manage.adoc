= Manage Alerts
:description: Learn how to search, filter, acknowledge, and resolve alerts, and how to test nodes affected by alerts.

You can manage your network's alerts on the *Alerts* page.
(Select **Alerts** in the left navigation menu.)
The page displays alerts, categorized by xref:reference:severities.adoc[severity], and a list of alerts filtered by time and type.

== Search

You can search for specific text in alerts.
To do so, type your search term in the *Search Alerts* box.
Note that the search works only with the full name or IP address associated with the alert.
It will not search for partial terms.
The search returns results only for alerts that occurred during the selected time range.
For example, if an alert occurred 7 days earlier, but you search for it in the *Today* tab, it will not appear.

== Filter

You can filter alerts by severity and by time span.

To filter alerts by severity, click the plus sign beside the severity (for example, *Major*) that has alarms.
The associated alerts are displayed.

To filter alerts by time span, select an option from the time filter settings (for example, *7D*).
The alerts that occurred over the specified time period are displayed.
By default, the page displays alerts that occurred within the last 24 hours.

=== Clear filters

To clear filters on your alerts click *Clear All Filters*.
The alerts list displays all alerts.
You can also click the `X` beside any alert severities at the top of the screen that you filtered on.

== View alert type definitions

To view a description of the alert type (for example, SNMP Cold Start), click the down arrow symbol (`Ë‡`) to the right of the alert.

== Acknowledge or clear an alert

Acknowledging an alert lets others know that someone has seen it.
Clearing an alert marks it as resolved.

To acknowledge or clear an alert, follow these steps:

. Choose *Alerts* in the left navigation menu.
. Filter to locate the alert you want to acknowledge or clear.
. Place a check in the checkbox beside each alert you want to acknowledge or clear.
. Beside the *Select All* field, click *Acknowledge* or *Clear*.

An acknowledged alert has a green symbol with a green with a white check

An alert is acknowledged when the symbol next to its date is green with a white check.
An alert is unacknowledged when the symbol next to its date is white with a green outline and check.

. Click the *Expand* symbol to show the alert's details.
. Select *Run Test*.
