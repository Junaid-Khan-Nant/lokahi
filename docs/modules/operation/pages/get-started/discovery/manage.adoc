:description: Learn how to manage the discovery of network inventory with OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud.

You can edit information, including discovery name, location, and tags, for active and passive discoveries.
When you save an edited active discovery, it runs again immediately, and then every 24 hours thereafter.
You may want to edit and run discoveries at times that will have the lowest impact on network performance.
//if toggle is on when I edit a passive discovery, will it run automatically, or do I need to turn the toggle on and off?

To edit a discovery, follow these steps:

. In the list of discoveries, click the one you want to edit.
. Change the information you want and click *Save Discovery*.

//any additional caveats about editing a discovery?
